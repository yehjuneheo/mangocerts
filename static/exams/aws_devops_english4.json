The DevOps team needs to ensure that they effectively monitor application performance and infrastructure health. They want to set up alerts for high latency and errors while also ensuring that they have a comprehensive view of their log data for troubleshooting purposes.",
        "Question": "Which combination of actions should the DevOps team take to achieve effective application and infrastructure monitoring?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Create CloudWatch Alarms for high latency and error metrics. Enable detailed monitoring for EC2 instances and set up log aggregation using CloudWatch Logs.",

They have multiple EC2 instances within an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) that must be initialized before the load balancer starts routing traffic. They want to ensure that the initialization of these instances is completed successfully before marking the stack creation as complete. As a DevOps Engineer, what approach should you recommend?",
