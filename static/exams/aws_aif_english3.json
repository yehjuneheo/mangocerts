        "Question": "Which tool would be the most suitable for fulfilling the healthcare provider’s requirements?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "The provider should use AWS Lambda, which enables running code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.",
            "2": "The provider should use Amazon Lookout for Equipment, which uses machine learning to detect anomalies and can provide insights through integrated dashboards, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor patient data effectively.",
            "3": "The provider should use Amazon CloudWatch, which is designed primarily for monitoring AWS resources rather than patient health data.",
            "4": "The provider should use Amazon RDS to manage and store patient health data without any visualization capabilities."
        },
        "Correct Answer": "The provider should use Amazon Lookout for Equipment, which uses machine learning to detect anomalies and can provide insights through integrated dashboards, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor patient data effectively.",
        "Explanation": "Amazon Lookout for Equipment is designed for anomaly detection using machine learning and provides actionable insights, making it suitable for monitoring patient health data and generating alerts for critical changes. Its ability to create intuitive dashboards aids healthcare professionals in making timely interventions.",
        "Other Options": [
            "AWS Lambda is useful for running code in response to events but does not specifically provide monitoring or visualization capabilities for patient data.",
            "Amazon RDS is a database service focused on data management and does not include visualization or anomaly detection functionalities.",
            "Amazon CloudWatch is primarily for monitoring AWS resources and lacks the specific capabilities needed for healthcare data monitoring."

        "Question Number": "65",
        "Topic": "3",
        "Situation": "A logistics company is using Amazon SageMaker to train a machine learning model for optimizing delivery routes. The team is evaluating various methods for fine-tuning the model using SageMaker’s built-in features to ensure it performs well with real-time traffic data and historical delivery patterns.",
        "Question": "Which service feature should the team use for fine-tuning?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Amazon SageMaker Feature Store",
            "2": "Amazon SageMaker JumpStart",
            "3": "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor",
            "4": "Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth"
        },
        "Correct Answer": "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor",
        "Explanation": "Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor allows the team to continuously monitor the performance of the machine learning model in production, including detecting data drift and ensuring the model's effectiveness with real-time traffic data and historical patterns. This feature is essential for fine-tuning the model based on actual performance metrics.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Amazon SageMaker Feature Store is useful for managing and serving features used in model training but is not directly for fine-tuning the model.",
            "Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides access to pre-built models and templates, but it does not specifically address the ongoing monitoring needed for fine-tuning.",
            "Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is focused on data labeling rather than the monitoring and fine-tuning of models post-deployment."
