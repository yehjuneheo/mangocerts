            "Create dedicated user groups for ML engineers with defined access rights."

        "Explanation": "Deploying the SageMaker endpoint within a Private Subnet of the VPC ensures that it is not publicly accessible, enhancing security. An Application Load Balancer can efficiently manage incoming traffic and distribute it to the endpoint based on demand, thereby optimizing resource utilization.",
        "Other Options": [

        "Explanation": "Bayesian optimization is an efficient hyperparameter tuning method that builds a probabilistic model of the function mapping hyperparameters to a performance metric, allowing it to balance exploration of new hyperparameter values with exploitation of known good values. This can lead to better performance with fewer evaluations compared to other methods.",
