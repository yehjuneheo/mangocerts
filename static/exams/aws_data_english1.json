        "Situation": "A data engineer is tasked with optimizing the performance of a large-scale data processing application that uses Amazon Athena. The application must ensure efficient querying of partitioned datasets while keeping costs under control.",
        "Question": "Which strategy would most effectively enhance query performance and manage costs in this scenario?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Keep data in text format without compression and query against a single unpartitioned dataset to simplify access for users.",
            "2": "Implement data partitioning by date and region, convert datasets to Parquet format, and set up workgroups with per-query limits on data scans.",
            "3": "Use CSV files for data storage and limit the number of partitions to reduce complexity, while enforcing a single workgroup without any cost controls.",
            "4": "Store all data in JSON format and compress it with GZIP, while allowing unlimited data scans for all queries to avoid query failures."
        },
        "Correct Answer": "Implement data partitioning by date and region, convert datasets to Parquet format, and set up workgroups with per-query limits on data scans.",
        "Explanation": "This approach effectively utilizes data partitioning to minimize the amount of data scanned by queries, enhances performance with the efficient Parquet format, and controls costs through workgroups and per-query limits, ensuring that queries do not exceed budgeted thresholds.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Using JSON format and GZIP compression does not provide the same performance benefits as Parquet, and allowing unlimited data scans can lead to unexpected costs and query failures.",
            "Storing data in CSV format and limiting partitions would not leverage the benefits of optimized data storage formats like Parquet or ORC, and a lack of cost controls can lead to high expenses.",
            "Keeping data in text format without compression and querying an unpartitioned dataset is inefficient as it leads to scanning large volumes of data, resulting in slow query performance and increased costs."

They need to ensure that all data at rest and in transit is encrypted to comply with regulatory standards. The organization is evaluating data encryption options available in AWS analytics services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, and AWS Glue.",
        "Question": "Which encryption option should the organization implement to ensure robust data security across the selected AWS analytics services?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Utilize VPC endpoint policies to restrict access to data without encryption in AWS Glue.",

        "Explanation": "Using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is the recommended approach for managing encryption keys and ensuring that data at rest in Amazon Redshift is encrypted. This approach allows for centralized key management and complies with security and regulatory standards.",
        "Other Options": [
            "While enabling server-side encryption with S3-managed keys is a valid option, it does not provide encryption for data at rest directly in Amazon Redshift and does not utilize KMS for key management.",

        "Explanation": "The correct SQL query filters records to include only those that are within the last five years and groups them by category, counting the total number of records in each category. This meets the requirement to filter and aggregate the data appropriately.",
        "Other Options": [
            "This option incorrectly filters out records older than five years instead of including them, which does not meet the requirement for the transformation.",

        "Explanation": "Managed services like Amazon RDS handle routine maintenance tasks such as backups, patching, and updates automatically, which helps ensure that security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly. This reduces the operational burden on the data engineering team and enhances overall data security and compliance with governance standards.",
