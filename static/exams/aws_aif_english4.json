They decide to use machine learning to forecast demand based on historical sales data, trends, and other influencing factors. However, the team is unsure about which type of learning algorithm to use for this specific problem and wants guidance on selecting the best approach.",
        "Question": "Which machine learning technique should the company choose for demand forecasting?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "They should use reinforcement learning, where the algorithm learns from rewards and penalties based on stock decisions.",
            "2": "They should use deep learning, as it can automatically decide on the optimal features without needing human intervention.",

        "Explanation": "Token-based pricing allows for scalability and cost efficiency, as the company only pays for the actual usage of resources. Additionally, considering regional coverage is essential because serving users globally while maintaining low latency might involve different costs depending on the region's infrastructure. This tradeoff helps the company optimize performance while managing their budget effectively.",
