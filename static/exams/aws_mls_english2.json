        "Question": "What is the most effective approach for the Data Scientist to identify and handle missing data, corrupt data, and stop words in the dataset?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Leverage AWS Lambda to create a function that removes missing data and corrupt entries from the dataset while also filtering stop words.",
            "2": "Implement a data cleaning pipeline using AWS Glue to filter out missing and corrupt entries, and use NLTK to remove stop words from the text.",
            "3": "Utilize Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler to visualize missing data patterns and apply built-in operations to clean the dataset, including stop word removal.",
            "4": "Use Amazon Comprehend to analyze the text data for stop words and missing values, then manually edit the dataset to correct any issues."

The model needs to interact with an Amazon RDS database for real-time predictions. The Engineer wants to ensure that the VPC setup allows the model to function without exposing it to the public internet.",
        "Question": "What is the best approach to securely deploy the machine learning model within the VPC while allowing it to communicate with the RDS database?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Use AWS Lambda in a public subnet to trigger the model for predictions.",
            "2": "Host the model on an EC2 instance outside the VPC to enable unrestricted internet access.",

        },
        "Correct Answer": "Deploy the model in a private subnet and configure a NAT gateway for outbound internet access as needed.",
        "Explanation": "Deploying the model in a private subnet ensures that it is not directly accessible from the internet, thus enhancing security. The NAT gateway allows the model to make outbound requests, such as to access the RDS database or other AWS services, while still keeping the model isolated from direct internet access.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Placing the model in a public subnet exposes it to the internet, which is a security risk and goes against the requirement for secure access.",

            "Apply Gradient Boosting Machines to build a strong predictive model."
        ],
        "Explanation": "Using a Random Forest Regressor is beneficial because it can effectively manage both numerical and categorical features, making it suitable for mixed data types. Additionally, Gradient Boosting Machines are powerful ensemble methods that can enhance predictive performance by combining multiple weak learners, leading to a more accurate model overall.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Implementing a Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel may not capture the complexities of the data effectively, especially if the relationships are non-linear, which is often the case in housing price predictions.",
            "Using a Convolutional Neural Network is inappropriate for this problem since CNNs are primarily designed for image data and spatial relationships, which are not relevant in the context of structured tabular data like housing features.",
            "While leveraging an Ensemble of Decision Trees can reduce overfitting, it is less specific than the Random Forest approach, which inherently includes mechanisms to combat overfitting while also handling mixed data types effectively."

        "Explanation": "The problem of predicting customer churn can be framed as a supervised classification problem, where the model learns from historical data to classify whether a customer will churn or not based on their attributes and past behavior.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Developing an unsupervised clustering model does not directly address the prediction of churn, as clustering is used to group data without predefined labels rather than predict specific outcomes.",
            "Creating a reinforcement learning model is inappropriate here since the goal is not to optimize interactions in an environment but to predict a specific outcome (churn) based on historical data.",
            "Implementing a time series analysis focuses on forecasting future values based on past trends, which does not align with the specific goal of predicting customer churn at a given point in time."

        },
        "Correct Answer": "F1 Score",
        "Explanation": "The F1 Score is the best choice for evaluating a model's performance in the presence of class imbalance, as it considers both precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is particularly useful when the costs of false positives and false negatives are different or when the focus is on the minority class.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Accuracy can be misleading in cases of class imbalance, as it may give a false sense of model performance by simply reflecting the majority class predictions.",
