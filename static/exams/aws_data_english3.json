        "Explanation": "Implementing exponential backoff with retries is the most effective strategy for handling API rate limits. This approach allows the service to pause and retry when limits are reached, ensuring that requests are made within the allowed thresholds while maintaining data integrity through logging.",
        "Other Options": [
