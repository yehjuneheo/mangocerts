        "Question": "Which of the following IP addresses are reserved in each subnet of a VPC and cannot be assigned to instances or other resources?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Network address .255, VPC router .3, Reserved for DNS .1, Reserved for future use .0, Broadcast address .1",
            "2": "Network address .1, VPC router .0, Reserved for DNS .3, Reserved for future use .2, Broadcast address .254",

        "Correct Answer": "Network address .0, VPC router .1, Reserved for DNS .2, Reserved for future use .3, Broadcast address .255",
        "Explanation": "In a VPC, the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet are reserved. Specifically, the IP address ending in .0 is the network address, .1 is reserved for the VPC router, .2 is reserved for DNS, .3 is reserved for future use, and .255 is the broadcast address (which is not used in AWS VPCs).",

        "Explanation": "TLS termination at the load balancer allows decryption of traffic at the load balancer level, which can simplify certificate management and reduce latency for backend servers. TLS passthrough maintains the encrypted connection all the way to the backend servers, ensuring end-to-end encryption, which is essential for sensitive data.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Using HTTP/2 for enhanced performance does not inherently secure data in transit. While HTTP/2 can improve performance through multiplexing and header compression, it does not address encryption or authentication directly without TLS.",
            "Using a private link for database connections relates to securing database communication rather than securing traffic handled by load balancers. While it is a good practice for database security, it does not apply to load balancing scenarios.",

        "Explanation": "AWS CloudFormation provides a robust way to define and provision infrastructure through code, ensuring that the provisioning process can be easily replicated and managed over time. It also supports version control, making it easier to track changes.",
        "Other Options": [
            "The AWS CLI method is not ideal for IaC as it involves manual commands that can lead to inconsistencies and does not provide the same level of version control as a template-based approach.",

        "Explanation": "Implementing AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated connection that can offer higher bandwidth and lower latency compared to standard internet connections. This is particularly beneficial for applications with high data transfer requirements, ensuring consistent performance without being affected by bandwidth limitations of public internet routes.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Using Amazon CloudFront is a good strategy for caching and content delivery, but it primarily benefits web applications rather than directly impacting bandwidth limits for all types of traffic. It does not address the underlying bandwidth issues for non-cacheable traffic.",
