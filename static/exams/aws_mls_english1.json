            "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is not ideal for this scenario because it can struggle with categorical features unless they are properly encoded, and it is generally less interpretable compared to ensemble methods like Random Forest.",
            "K-Means Clustering is not appropriate for prediction tasks as it is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering rather than classification or regression.",

        "Situation": "A financial institution is developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions. The data science team has built several models and is evaluating them based on their performance using ROC and AUC metrics. They are particularly interested in finding the optimal threshold to balance sensitivity and specificity while maximizing the area under the ROC curve.",
        "Question": "Which strategies can the team use to effectively determine the optimal threshold for their models? (Select Two)",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Calculate the AUC for each model, and choose the model with the lowest AUC as the best performer based on separation power.",
            "2": "Utilize the ROC curve generated from the models to visually assess performance and choose the threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity.",
            "3": "Select the threshold that results in a 0.5 AUC value, as this indicates a balanced model.",
            "4": "Generate multiple confusion matrices at various threshold levels and plot the corresponding sensitivity against (1 - specificity) to identify the knee point.",

        "Correct Answer": [
            "Generate multiple confusion matrices at various threshold levels and plot the corresponding sensitivity against (1 - specificity) to identify the knee point.",
            "Utilize the ROC curve generated from the models to visually assess performance and choose the threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity."
        ],
        "Explanation": "The first correct option involves generating confusion matrices at various thresholds, allowing the team to visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity through a plot, which helps in identifying the optimal threshold or knee point. The second correct option emphasizes the importance of the ROC curve in assessing model performance and selecting a threshold that optimally balances sensitivity and specificity.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Selecting a threshold that results in a 0.5 AUC value is incorrect because an AUC of 0.5 indicates a model with no discrimination power, akin to random guessing. A higher AUC is preferable for better model performance.",
            "Choosing the model with the lowest AUC is incorrect as it contradicts the objective of selecting the model with the highest AUC, which indicates better separation power between classes.",
            "While applying cross-validation is a good practice, it does not directly relate to finding the optimal threshold based on the ROC curve and sensitivity-specificity trade-off. Thus, it is not specifically effective for this scenario."
