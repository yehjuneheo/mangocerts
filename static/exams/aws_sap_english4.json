        "Situation": "A global e-commerce company is experiencing latency issues when serving users in different geographic regions. To improve user experience, the company wants to implement a DNS solution that directs users to the nearest application endpoint while also considering traffic patterns. The architecture must be designed to handle user traffic efficiently and ensure the highest availability. (Select Two)",
        "Question": "Which of the following options should the Solutions Architect implement to optimize DNS routing for the e-commerce application?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Create a simple routing policy in Amazon Route 53 that points all users to a single application endpoint, regardless of their location.",
