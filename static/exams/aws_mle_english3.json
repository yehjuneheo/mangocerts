            "1": "Increase the complexity of the model by adding more layers to the neural network.",
            "2": "Reduce the size of the training dataset to speed up the training process.",
            "3": "Collect more high-quality features from the data to improve feature representation.",
            "4": "Change the model's activation function to a less common one."
        },
        "Correct Answer": "Collect more high-quality features from the data to improve feature representation.",
        "Explanation": "Improving feature representation by collecting more high-quality features can significantly enhance model performance, as it provides the model with better insights into the patterns within the data.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Increasing the complexity of the model may lead to overfitting, especially if there is not enough data to support it, which could reduce generalization on unseen data.",
            "Reducing the size of the training dataset is counterproductive as it limits the amount of information the model can learn from, ultimately impairing accuracy.",

        "Question": "Which AWS tool should the engineer use to visualize historical spending trends and forecast future costs?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "AWS Cost and Usage Report",

        "Situation": "A data scientist is tuning a neural network model to improve its performance on a classification task. The model's architecture includes several layers, each with different numbers of neurons. The data scientist is considering how the number of layers and neurons can affect the model's accuracy and training time.",
        "Question": "What is the potential impact of increasing the number of layers in a neural network model?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "It will always improve the model's accuracy regardless of other factors.",
            "2": "It will make the model easier to interpret and understand.",
            "3": "It will decrease the model's computational complexity and training time.",
            "4": "It may lead to better feature extraction but could also cause overfitting."
        },
        "Correct Answer": "It may lead to better feature extraction but could also cause overfitting.",
        "Explanation": "Increasing the number of layers in a neural network can allow the model to learn more complex features from the data, which can improve performance. However, a deeper network also increases the risk of overfitting, especially if the training data is limited, as the model may start to memorize the training data rather than generalize.",
        "Other Options": [
            "While adding layers can improve accuracy, it does not guarantee an improvement as it depends on other factors like data quality and quantity.",
            "Increasing layers typically increases computational complexity and training time, rather than decreasing it, as more parameters need to be optimized.",
            "More layers usually complicate the interpretation of the model, making it harder to understand, rather than making it easier to interpret."

        "Correct Answer": "The number of features used in the training dataset.",
        "Explanation": "The number of features directly influences the model size since each feature adds complexity and dimensionality to the model. More features typically require more parameters, increasing the model size.",
        "Other Options": [
            "The type of algorithm selected can influence performance and training time but does not necessarily dictate the model size as significantly as the number of features.",
