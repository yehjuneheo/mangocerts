        "Explanation": "This option effectively meets the requirement by utilizing AWS-managed encryption for data at rest through SSE-S3, which eliminates the need for key management and operational overhead. Additionally, using HTTPS ensures that data is encrypted in transit, fulfilling the compliance requirement with minimal management efforts.",
        "Other Options": [

        "Explanation": "Security groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Configuring them to allow specific traffic ensures that only legitimate connections are made while denying all other traffic, thus providing robust security for VPC resources.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Setting up network ACLs to allow all traffic does not provide effective security. Network ACLs are stateless and allowing all traffic can expose the resources to unnecessary risks. They should be used to restrict access, not allow it indiscriminately.",

It supports PKCS#11, JCE, and CNG for integration with SQL Server and Oracle databases running on EC2, enabling transparent data encryption. This is essential for compliance in cases where sensitive data is involved.",
        "Other Options": [

The application requires specific IAM roles to be attached to the EC2 instances, but the security team has noticed that overly permissive IAM roles have been assigned inadvertently, allowing access to unnecessary AWS resources. The team needs to identify and rectify these unintended permissions to ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced.",
