In light of recent security incidents, the company wants to enhance its incident response capabilities. The security team needs a solution that enables them to quickly identify, investigate, and respond to potential security threats across all accounts.",
        "Question": "Which of the following approaches would provide the MOST effective incident response strategy for the organization?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Implement AWS CloudTrail to log API calls and use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor for suspicious activity across all accounts.",

        },
        "Correct Answer": "Utilize AWS GuardDuty to analyze account activity and provide security findings, while integrating it with AWS Security Hub for a centralized view.",
        "Explanation": "Utilizing AWS GuardDuty in conjunction with AWS Security Hub provides a comprehensive solution for threat detection and incident response. GuardDuty continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior, while Security Hub aggregates findings and provides a centralized dashboard for incident management, enhancing the organization's overall security posture.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Implementing AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch is essential for monitoring API calls, but it lacks the automated threat detection and centralized management that GuardDuty and Security Hub provide.",

        "Explanation": "Allowing both TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 ensures that the load balancer can communicate securely with a wider range of clients, including those that may not yet support the latest TLS version. This configuration strikes a balance between security and compatibility.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Configuring the load balancer to use only TLS 1.2 and disabling older versions may improve security but could exclude clients that do not support TLS 1.2, which can lead to accessibility issues for some users.",
            "Using self-signed certificates for TLS is generally not recommended for production environments due to trust issues; it can lead to security warnings in clients and does not provide the same level of assurance as certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority.",

            "While centralized logging and email alerts can be useful, they do not encompass the proactive measures needed for effective incident response and securing network architecture.",
            "Creating a dedicated security team may help, but it does not ensure company-wide preparedness and could lead to delayed responses if only major incidents are reported.",
            "Utilizing Amazon CloudTrail for logging is important, but restricting access to a specific IP range is not sufficient for securing public APIs, and it does not address the need for regular incident response training."
