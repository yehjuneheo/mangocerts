            "Warm Standby typically involves a scaled-down version of a fully functional environment that is running and can take over more quickly than a Pilot Light, but it is not as minimal in terms of resources, making it less cost-effective for certain scenarios.",
            "Multi-site/Hot-site strategies involve running full replicas of the environment in multiple locations, which provides the fastest recovery but at a significantly higher cost and complexity, making it less suitable for organizations looking to minimize expenses.",
