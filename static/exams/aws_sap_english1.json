        "Situation": "A company is running a web application on a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application experiences variable traffic patterns throughout the day, with peak loads occurring during business hours. The company needs to ensure that the application can scale appropriately to handle the increased load while minimizing costs during off-peak hours. The solutions architect needs to implement an Auto Scaling policy that responds to changes in demand effectively.",
        "Question": "Which Auto Scaling policy should the solutions architect implement to optimize the scaling of the EC2 instances based on the application load while ensuring cost efficiency?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Implement a target tracking scaling policy that adjusts the number of instances based on the average CPU utilization metric.",
            "2": "Configure a scheduled scaling policy that adds instances at a specific time each day without regard to actual demand.",
            "3": "Use a step scaling policy that increases the number of instances based on specific thresholds of network traffic metrics.",

        "Correct Answer": "Implement a target tracking scaling policy that adjusts the number of instances based on the average CPU utilization metric.",
        "Explanation": "A target tracking scaling policy automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances to maintain a specified level of CPU utilization, which allows for dynamic scaling in response to actual load. This approach optimizes performance while controlling costs by scaling down during low demand periods.",
        "Other Options": [
            "A scheduled scaling policy does not account for actual demand fluctuations and can lead to over-provisioning or under-provisioning of resources, resulting in unnecessary costs or performance issues.",
            "While a step scaling policy based on network traffic can work, it may not directly correlate with application performance and can lead to delays in scaling actions, especially if traffic patterns are unpredictable.",
            "A simple scaling policy that only scales in based on CPU utilization does not allow for proactive scaling out during peak demand, which may result in degraded performance and a poor user experience."
