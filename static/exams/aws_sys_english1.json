        "Other Options": [
            "Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on the number of log events does not specifically filter for API calls and may lead to irrelevant alerts.",
            "Setting up a Lambda function to parse log files is unnecessary when metric filters can directly extract and monitor the needed information from CloudWatch Logs.",

        "Situation": "A company has multiple AWS accounts organized under an AWS Organization. The security team is tasked with ensuring that service control policies (SCPs) are correctly implemented to enforce compliance and restrict certain actions across the organization. The team needs to validate the SCPs in place for specific accounts to ensure they align with compliance requirements.",
        "Question": "Which of the following actions should the SysOps Administrator take to effectively validate the service control policies (SCPs) applied to accounts within the organization?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Use the AWS CLI to list the SCPs and their effects on the specific accounts.",
            "2": "Check the AWS Config rules to ensure resources are compliant with the SCPs.",
            "3": "Log in to each account and manually review the permissions for each user.",
            "4": "Review the IAM policies attached to IAM roles in the accounts to ensure they comply."
        },
        "Correct Answer": "Use the AWS CLI to list the SCPs and their effects on the specific accounts.",
        "Explanation": "Using the AWS CLI to list the SCPs provides a direct way to see the policies applied to accounts and their effects. This method allows the administrator to verify whether the policies are correctly restricting or allowing actions as intended, thus ensuring compliance.",
        "Other Options": [
            "Reviewing the IAM policies attached to IAM roles does not directly validate the SCPs, as IAM policies operate independently from SCPs, which apply at the account level.",
            "Checking the AWS Config rules does not validate SCPs specifically; rather, it assesses compliance of AWS resources and configurations against defined rules, which is a different aspect of security.",
            "Manually reviewing permissions for each user is inefficient and prone to error; it does not provide a comprehensive view of the SCPs applied at the organizational level."

The administrator wants to leverage a feature that accelerates the upload speed for these users, specifically for large files transferred over long distances.

        "Correct Answer": "Enable the GuardDuty integration in the Security Hub settings.",
        "Explanation": "To ensure that all findings from GuardDuty are reported in AWS Security Hub, the integration between these two services must be enabled. This allows Security Hub to automatically receive and display findings from GuardDuty.",
