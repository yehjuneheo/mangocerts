        "Options": {
            "1": "Configure the ASG with a minimum size of 2, desired size of 4, and maximum size of 6. Use a launch template to define instance parameters. Implement a scheduled scaling policy to increase capacity every weekday at 9 AM.",

A DevOps engineer is tasked with setting up a code, image, and artifact repository that can efficiently manage these resources.",
