The engineer is considering various AWS services to manage the CI/CD pipeline for their ML workflow. They need to select tools that are highly integrated and can efficiently support version control, build, and deployment of their ML models.",
        "Question": "Which combination of AWS services would best facilitate the automation of the ML model deployment process in this scenario?",
        "Options": {
            "1": "Leverage AWS Lambda for deployment, AWS Elastic Beanstalk for version control, and AWS CloudFormation for orchestration.",
            "2": "Use AWS CodePipeline for orchestration, AWS CodeBuild for building artifacts, and AWS CodeDeploy for deploying the model.",

        "Correct Answer": "Use AWS CodePipeline for orchestration, AWS CodeBuild for building artifacts, and AWS CodeDeploy for deploying the model.",
        "Explanation": "AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy are specifically designed to work together to create a robust CI/CD pipeline. CodePipeline orchestrates the workflow, CodeBuild compiles the code and runs tests, and CodeDeploy automates the deployment process to various compute services, making this combination ideal for automating ML model deployment.",
        "Other Options": [
            "AWS Lambda is not typically used for deployment of models but rather for running code in response to events. AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service and does not provide version control. AWS CloudFormation is used for infrastructure as code, so this combination does not effectively address the deployment automation.",
            "Amazon SageMaker is excellent for model hosting but does not cover the entire CI/CD pipeline. AWS Glue is a data preparation tool and not meant for deployment, while AWS Step Functions manage workflows but do not directly deploy models.",
            "Amazon EC2 can be used for serving models, but it requires manual deployment processes without the automation benefits of CodeDeploy. AWS Batch is designed for batch processing and is not suited for real-time model deployment, while AWS OpsWorks is more focused on configuration management rather than deployment of ML models."
